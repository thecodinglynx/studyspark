# StudySpark

A modern flashcard study companion built with Next.js 14, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, and NextAuth.

## Getting started

```powershell
npm install
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after the dev server starts.

## Exposing the dev server on your local network

1. Ensure your computer and target device (for example, an Android phone) are on the same Wiâ€‘Fi network.
2. Set the public URL so NextAuth sessions work off localhost:

   ```powershell
   $env:NEXTAUTH_URL="http://<your-lan-ip>:3000"
   ```

   Replace `<your-lan-ip>` with the IPv4 address returned by `ipconfig` (for example, `192.168.1.42`).

3. Start the server in LAN mode:

   ```powershell
   npm run dev:lan
   ```

4. On your phone, open `http://<your-lan-ip>:3000`. The site should load and allow authentication with the LAN URL that you set.

> Tip: If you need remote access outside your network, wrap the dev server with a tunneling tool such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or the [Vercel CLI preview proxy](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/tunnel).

## Mobile optimization highlights

- Responsive typography and spacing for the landing page and study views.
- Flip cards adapt to smaller screens with dynamic height, padding, and word wrapping.
- Study statistics, control buttons, and recent-session lists collapse gracefully on phones.

Use your browser's device toolbar (Chrome DevTools `Ctrl+Shift+M`) to preview different breakpoints.

## Useful scripts

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide values for:

- `DATABASE_URL` (and optionally `NEON_DATABASE_URL` for clarity)
- `DIRECT_URL` (and optionally `NEON_DIRECT_URL`)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`

For LAN access, keep `NEXTAUTH_URL` aligned with the hostname you're using (e.g., `http://192.168.1.42:3000`).
